![GIF example](/Artwork/artwork.gif)

Ever end up wanting to reset your layer names, so the name reflects your text content? How about having to do that repeatedly for TONS of layers or components? ðŸ˜°  It's not possible to reset them all at once, UNTIL NOW!

"How do I get started?"

Easy! Just select any amount of text layers, and run the "Reset Text Layer Name" command. 

Boom! You're done. ðŸŽ‰
